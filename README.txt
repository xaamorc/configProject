Hi my name is Gonzalo 

I'm from Argentina and I'm 18 years old

I currently work as a waiter in a restaurant and I'm studying to be a chef

I like to play video games, watch movies and series, listen to music and play the guitar

I'm looking for someone to talk to and have a good time

I'm not very good at talking about myself but I hope we can get to know each other better

I hope you have a good day

My uncle is a butcher and he has a lot of meat

I'm sorry if my English is not very good

But Gonzalo is a very good name

I'm sorry if I'm not very good at talking about myself

But Gonzalo is very shy and doesn't know what to say

I hope you have a good day
Bye bye

- Gonzalo
